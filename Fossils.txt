==== Fossils ====
Angelegt Sunday 26 January 2020
@MRF @GEOLOGY @fossils @ESH @YEAR1 

== Prebiotic Processes ==
@Chemosynthesis Oragnic molecules → @DNA → membrane enclosed organelles → true cells 
@Miller_Urey experiment focussed on the atmosphere
@Sugar_Synthesis

Bigger organic molecules have been found in interstellar space and other planets → chemosynthesis was not confined to earth
What is life? What are we looking for in @SETI 

== First life forms ==
The @Isua Gneiss and @RuBisCo was the first evidence of 'life', with much @debate to its origin

== Tree of life ==
@tree_of_life 
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
@LUCA is at the centre and the branches represent genetic differences, getting further away from LUCA
@Eukaryotes are a very large group (containing humans)

== Archea ==
@Archea are the most closely related to LUCA → most primitive and therefore ancient beings
Microscopic

@extremophiles: 
	* cope with sedimentary pressure, 
	* @halophiles can live in pure brine. They drink the moisture film in between the salt crystals, which is the only water they need.
	* @therophiles live in hot springs in @yellowstone . The record is 113° 
	* @cryophiles have very slow metabolic rates but survive on the nutrient supply alone. Like the halophiles, they drink the water between the ice crystals.
	* @Acidophiles can survive in concentrated acids.

Archea were discovered in hospitals when surgeons tried to sterilise surgical equipment but caused the thermophiles to reproduce in the high heat
Archea live in environments do extreme that it constantly damages their DNA → they have @Enzymes to repair it rapidly. → used in @cancer research. This protection could have protected them in space if @Panspermia is true.

Some can break down @hydrocarbons causing problems for crude oil extraction
The question is have they always been down there, or have these environments been contaminated by drill bits?
It is accepted that they have always been part of the deep @biosphere
Perhaps this is where life originated from - the @deep_life_hypothesis 

== Prokaryotes → Eukaryotes ==
@history 
@Endosymbiosis was proposed by @Willhelm_Schimper but his textbook was largely ignored
@Lynn_Margulis independently formulated the same idea

A Prokaryote ate anaerobic bacteria and it became mitochondria for the cell. The cell gave the bacteria shelter, and the bacteria gave the cell energy, making primitive animal cells.
 Followed by @Cyanobacteria which then became chloroplasts, making primitive plant cells.
The development forked at the mitochondria stage to make animal and plant cells → plants are further evolved than we are
It is believed that all cells originate from @serial_Endosymbiosis 

@Prokaryotes have no organelles - the cell contents floats freely in the @cytoplasm ≠ @Eukaryotes which have complex internal @compartmentalisation 
Modern cell @organelles have two membranes:
* The cell surface membrane of the cell that was eaten
* The one the hunter cell made around it for compartmentalisation.

@Endosymbiosis is not @Darwinism , more like @Lamark if the changes are acquired in the organism's lifetime.

===== Darwin's Dilemma =====
* @Darwin faced @Darwins_Dilema; the fossil record was incomplete but there was an @anogenetic trend (progress towards more complex life)
* Darwin couldn't work out why if going back in time produced more primitive life why there was no fossil record at the beginning of the @phanerozoic . 
* Neither microbial life or the @cambrian_explosion  had not been discovered yet. 
* He predicted a linear relationship between ancestor and descendent - that everything must be preceded by something more primitive.
* His dilemma was: 'where are the ancestors of the Trilobites?'
* He said that the older a rock is, the higher the change it no longer existsm due to @metamorphic activity and @tectonic @overprint
* Multicellular life didn't emerge until the @ediacaran 




== Oldest Fossils ==
* The oldest @fossils might be at @apex_chert in Australia
* Because it is the first, the strata can't be dated. The @chert can't be dated but the volcanic lava around it can.
* Estimated to be ~3465 Ga old ( @archean ) 
* Much @debate over whether they are prokaryote fossils or nothing at all
* Segmented structures could be microfossils of remains of cellular subdivisions or filamentous cyanobacteria fossils. @Cyanobacteria have lots of different @morphotypes , but some of the 'fossils' showed branching structures which @Prokaryotes are known not to be able to do
* @Cyanobacteria ≠ Hetrotrophic bacteria

== Stromatolites ==
The next oldest evidence of life are the @stromatolites
Aged at 3.40 Ga, there's not much time between this and the Apex Chert 


== Gunflint Flora ==
@Gunflint @chert deposits ({{./equation001.png}})
Very high biodiversity
Wide array of fossils (mostly prokaryotic and archeans)
No Eukaryotes found
@Colonial alage were found (where cells live in a wheel shape around each other - see B below)
Very high silica content -> @sicilification (minerals being replaced by {{./equation002.png?type=equation}})
Proper multicellular life didn't appear until the neoproterzoic

== Grypania ==
@Grypania are the first macroscopic fossils
