A very small fraction of biomass is fossilised (0.1-1%)
Even mass accumulations only have 2-3%

@taphonomy is the study of how things are fossilised
Fossilisation needs anoxic or @euxinic conditions which prevents scavengers from eating the organism.
@Silicification is the process where the Silica in @diagenesis fluids replaces the organic matter.
