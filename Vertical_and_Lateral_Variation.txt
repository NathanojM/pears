== Stratigraphic Cycles ==
We see the sum of 1st, 2nd and 3rd order stratigraphic cycles that impact @sea_level

The amount of time the cycle takes is proportional to the amount of sea level rise in metres.

* 1st order: 	100s of Ma - @Wilson_Cycle and the breakup/ joining of supercontinents
* 2nd order: 	10s of 	Ma - volume of magma produced at @mid_ocean_ridges → more sea floor spreading
* 3rd order: 	1-10 	Ma - small changes in Earth's shape → small sea level changes
* 4th order:	2-5 	Ma - glaciers

== Stratigraphy ==
Majority of sediments in the fossil record are marine because accommodation space controls the rate of accumulation.
No space → no deposition

The base level depends on the balance between erosion and deposition
Generally erosion happens on land and deposition happens in the ocean, but erosion can happen below sea level:
	* Storms → erosion of continental shelf
	* Downcutting → canyon formation
	* Deep sea currents → erosion of sea floor

The stratographic record is very incomplete because of high levels of erosion → there are more gaps than there is record.

== Base level of aggradation ==
The @Aggradation base level is the level above which sediments can't accumulate permanently
