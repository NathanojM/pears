**Relative dating**: how old a rock is compared to surrounding rocks
Can use way-up criteria such as tree roots to determine which way up the rock is → know which is older @Super_Position 
Tectonic thrust can put old on top of young

@Original_Horizontiality can be tilted from tectonics and subscidence → not straight

@Original_Continuity 
@biostratigraphy 	Any evidence of past life = fossil

@Antiform = structure where you don't know which way up it is

@Zircon crystals have age zoning around their core

**Absolute Dating:** Age in actual number of years (tree rings, growth layers in @bivalves )
Need to understand how complete the record is , and how much time is represented in each strata.
Lots of sediment in a short time → high resolution = @stratographic_dilution ≠ @stratographic_concentration
