=== Unconformities ===
@GEOLOGY @ESH @YEAR1 
Created Tuesday 10 March 2020
An unconformity is a contact where the top unit is much younger than the lower.
Contacts can be sharp, clear, or gradiational
@unconformities indicate a major sedimentary break which could indicate a number of things:
	* Change in the sediment supply
	* Change in accommodation space
	* Changes in erosion rates

== Angular Unconformities ==
Older sedimentary rocks underneath are tilted.
Example: Grand Canyon

== Nonconformity ==
@nonconformity 
Where younger sedimentary rocks have been deposited on top of older @igneous or @metamorphic rocks

== Disconformity ==
@disconformity  
Unconformity between parallel layers of sedimentary rocks 
Generally indicates a shorter time interval than an unconformity

== Paraconformity ==
An unconformity where the strata are parallel and there is no erosional surface between them.
A @diastem is a minor @Paraconformity or minor interruption

== Cross cutting relationships ==
The Principle of @Cross_cutting_relationships states that any rocks are older than those cutting through them - useful for relative dating

== Contacts/ Boundaries ==
* @Contact 		Surface between different rock types
* Conformity	Strata are unbroken and uninterrupted. A conformable contact needs material to be eroded and enough accommodation space
* Unconformity	A significant hiatus where the strata are not continuous. Often idicates erosion but no deposition. There may be a period of non deposition even though the accommodation space exists.
