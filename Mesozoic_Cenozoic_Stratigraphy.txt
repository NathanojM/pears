=== Mesozoic Cenozoic Stratigraphy ===
Created Sunday 05 April 2020
@GEOLOGY @ESH  @YEAR1 

The @Triassic comes from the German 3 part rock division called 'Trias'
Split into :
	* Bunter - Sandstone
	* Muschelkalk - Limestone
	* @Keuper  - Calcareous Mudstone

@Bunter and @Muschelkalk formed on land →  no fossils
Muschelkalk didn't spread far → hard to make correlations

== Mass Extinctions ==
@mass_extinction 
{{./image.D3YTI0.png?width=400}}
* The end of the @permian  began with a huge drop in the diversity of life.
* It is believed that there was no one single cause of the @permian_extinction but a sequence of many causes building up to the extinction. 	@gradualism
This included:
	* Formation of @pangaea → loss of habitats in shallow marine environments
	* Siberian Traps (one of the biggest @volcanoes eruption ever)

The Triassic then saw a huge diversification of of plants and animals, including the first mammals and @dinosaurs
2 families of @amonites survived, diversified, and became widespread because they were 
	* @Pelagic (meaning in the open sea)
	* Evolving and adapting fast
	* Independent from their environment

====== Paleogeography ======
2 rifts on Pangaea created @Laurasia @Gondwanaland and @Eurasia  
{{./pasted_image.png}}

Continental rifting creates accommodation space to be filled with stratigraphy
The North Sea basin was filled with oil and gas, ready to be expolited.

== Red Beds ==
Triassic @Red_Beds were very common on Pangaea and were deposited in arid deserts. The red rocks are either Triassic or Devonian

Triassic = New Red Sandstone
Devonian = Old Red Sandstone

Red = continental
Green = marine

====== Jurassic ======
Named after the Jura Mountains between France and Switzerland
Dominated by dinosaurs
Ferns diversify
@amonites 
Ocean ridges developed in the middle Jurassic

Rifting → lots of marine deposition:
