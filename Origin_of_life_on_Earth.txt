=== Origin of life on Earth ===
Created Thursday 30 January 2020
@GEOLOGY @ESH @YEAR1 

'Where did life come from is one of the most fundamental issues,f ever.  Is it unique? How common is life?
There is no straightforward answer to how life emerged from dead things.

The @scientific_method means that we can't ever actually prove anything, but only disprove.

Time on Earth is divided into two major sections: the @Precambrian  and the @phanerozoic 
Phanerozoic is greek for 'visible life' ‚â† @Cryptozoic  (an old name for the Precambrian ) meaning 'hidden life'
The Precambrian accounts for 75%+ of the whole 4.5 Ga

== Panspermia ==
See [[Panspermia]]

== Prebiotic Processes/ Chemosynthesis ==
There was no free oxygen in atmosphere when life began, creating a @reducing_environment, which is what may have allowed it to form.
Oxygen would have created an oxidising environment and instantly broken down any biological molecules.

== The early atmosphere ==
@atmosphere high in:
* @methane
* @ammonia
* @hydrogen
* @nitrogen
* {{./equation.png?type=equation}}
* liquid and vaporised water, which may have been brought to Earth by @comets 
* These gases probably came from @volcanoes 
* Mixed together, they became the @primordial_soup 


There were no higher molecules such as carbohydrates. Also no @oxygen in the atmosphere or ocean ‚Üí highly @reducing_environment 

== Forming organic molecules ==
* The @Miller_Urey experiment recreated the original atmosphere
* They dissolved Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Ammonia, and {{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
 in liquid and vapourised water and  exposed it to simulated lightning strikes.
* The transparaent liquid turned yellow/ brown and organic molecules were found, including cyanides, glycine and @glutamic_acid (required for @Sugar_Synthesis )
* The @organic molecules were formed without life. The synthesis of these molecules from @primordial_soup is called @prebiotic_evolution or @Chemosynthesis 
* Organic matter has been found in meteors, but meteorites that have fallen to Earth are contaminated with Earth life.

== What are we looking for? ==

One of the major problems when searching for life elsewhere in the universe is defining what life actually is, and we need to know what we're looking for.
We understand  life to:
	* Self replicate
	* Grow
	* Have @metabolism (Consume energy from its environment and produce waste)
	* Avoid decay into equilibrium (defined by @Schr√∂dinger)
	* Be Subject to evolution
	* Interact with its environment
	* Move
	* Be able to be killed (although this is a tautology)
	* Do @homeostatis (the ability to regulate its own internal environment)
But there are exceptions to  all of these:
	* Bubbles in the washing machine replicate, but are not alive
	* @Unicellular_life doesn't really grow
	* A fridge can regulate its own environment

	* All molecules try to fall into the lowest energy state possible, which would mean death ‚Üí life fights against this an tries to put energy into the system:
	{{./pasted_image001.png?width=400}}
	However, this can be achieved without being alive through endo and exothermic reactions.

Life somewhere else in the universe might be very different to that on Earth, and we don't really know what we're looking for.
Looking for @RuBisCo on @mars suggests that it evolved on Earth and Mars - very unlikely.

===== Prebiotic processes =====

== Sugar Synthesis ==
@Sugar_Synthesis 
Sugars can store and release energy without being alive:
The condensation reaction releases water, storing energy in the @oxygen_bridge , which is released when water is added.  This happens without being alive.
{{./pasted_image007.png}}


== Lipids ==
Biochemical reactions cannot happen if the reactants are not in close proximity to each other.
Life needs a container - something to separate it from its environment.
Life is contained within cell walls or cell membranes to make sure that the reactants do actually meet.
@Lipid molecules spontaneously organise themselves into structures

{{./pasted_image008.png}}
@micelles form spontaneously 

 @Lipid s  will settle out into a monolayer, but this is unstable because it can be immediately cracked by water
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
	‚Üí organised into a stable @Phospholipid_bilayer  which can't be dissolved by water and is a discrete and finite space for biochemical reactions to happen.
	Molecules have to come into contact to react ‚Üí @cell_membranes enable biochemical reactions to happen.
	

== Sequence of Life ==
{{./diagram.png?type=diagram}}
@RNA is more stable than @DNA
It contains Uracil instead of Thymine
It's oxy
DNA can't replicate ‚â† RNA ‚Üí RNA acts as an enzyme as well as information storage.
