=== Principle of Faunal Succession ===
Created Tuesday 10 March 2020
@GEOLOGY @ESH @YEAR1 

* Every species goes extinct eventually
* @Index_Fossils are @fossils of organisms that lived for a very short amount of time → useful for correlation between continents because land organisms couldn't cross oceans. Based on the @law_of_faunal_succession
* the presence of the same fossil means that the rocks are the same age

Fossils can be seuqneced in time order
The @biostratigraphy gives us relative ages of the fossils and the rocks → @Lithostratigraphy

The last appearance datum is the point at which the fossil stops appearing in the record
Using the First and last @appearance_datum at each locality, their time periods can be calculated
Barren shales have no index fossils → they can't be dated with biostratigraphy → must rely on lithostratigraphy
