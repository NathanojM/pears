==== Correlation ====
Created Thursday 09 April 2020
@GEOLOGY @ESH  @YEAR1 
Match and link units of similar lithology

Identify depositional environment → draw @correlation lines between @facies → make interpretation

Specific lithologies are deposited in limited areas because of the limited lateral extent of the depositional environments.

== Walther's law of Correlation ==
@Walthers_law_of_facies_correlation 
Only works if the sedimentation is uninterrupted, but all successions have minor @unconformities → successions are never 100% unbroken
