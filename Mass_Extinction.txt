=== Mass Extinction ===
Created Monday 10 February 2020 
@GEOLOGY @ESH  @YEAR1 
5 major mass extinctions

The largest ever @mass_extinction event was the @permian_extinction
90-96% of all species lost

**Ordovician - Silurian extinction** was climate change induced:
Global cooling → sea levels fall → continental shelves exposed → marine creatures suffocated
70% of all species lost

**Devonian - Carboniferous extinction**
Series of extinctions over 20 million years → 70% of species lost

**Triassic - Jurassic extinction	**
Lost 70-75%, leaving @dinosaurs with no competition

**Cretacious - Paleogene extinction or 'K/Pg'**
//The K comes from the German 'Kriede' meaning Cretacious//
Demise of the Dinosaurs
Lost 75%

We are in the @sixth_extinction 

Extinctions open up new @niches 
Without death there can be no evolution and therefore no new life.

===== Anaerobic mass extinction =====
@anaerobic 
@Anaerobic_mass_extinction = the @great_oxidation_event  

The evolution of organisms using @photosynthesis produced @oxygen which is toxic to anaerobes. This was a long and drawn out process over hundreds of millions of years and resulted in anaerobes retreating into more extreme and enoxic places → more specific niches.

There are still @Enzymes in us that are very sensitive to oxygen, and our @telomere shorten with age from oxidation.
