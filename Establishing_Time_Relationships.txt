=== Chronostratigraphy ===
Created Wednesday 12 August 2020
@GEOLOGY @ESH @YEAR1 

@Chronostratigraphy = establishing time relationships, as an integration of the following:
	* @biostratigraphy = fossil rocord, @law_of_faunal_succession . Rarely, @fossils can survive @metamorphic processes 
	* @Magnetostratigraphy = magnetic properties of rocks
	* @Allostratigraphy = rock units defined by @unconformities and features resulting from changes in base level (where erosion and deposition are in equilibrium, either on a global scale (the sea) or a local scale (local). 	@depositional_base_layer 
	* @Geochronology =Determining absolute rock ages from @Isotope @geochemistry or @radiometric_dating 

== Assumptions and limitations ==
@Milankovitch 
@eccentricity is assumed to have always been the same because of the distance between the earth and the @sun 
@Obliquity changes because the moon was closer to earth during the cambrian, but is now moving away

Elements decay into other elements â†’ many don't survive @radioactive_decay
