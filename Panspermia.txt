====== Panspermia ======
Created Thursday 02 February 2023

* @Panspermia is the idea the life on earth came from comets
* The start of life coincides with the heavy bombardment phase
* Extremophiles could have survived the journey and landed on earth in a dormant state
* Organic matter is common in space but ‚â† life per se.
* üìñÔ∏èhttps://www.helix.northwestern.edu/2008/12/02/origin-of-life-the-panspermia-theory/
* Can be interplanetary (within the same star system) or interstellar

===== Vectors =====
@vector 
@Interstellar_dust 
@asteroids 
@comets 
@Nomadic_planets
Contaminated spacecraft

===== Mechanisms =====
@Radiopanspermia (propulsion via radiation pressure from stars)
@Lithopanspermia (transported inside rocks) [Wesson, 2010]
@Directed_panspermia (deliberate panspermia)
@Necropanspermia (living material arrives on Earth dead but then gives rise to new life) [Wesson, 2010]
@Pseudo_panspermia is the theory that @organic matter originated in space (now widely accepted)


===== Amino acids =====
@amino_acids have two @Stereoisomers : 'L' and 'D'

{{./pasted_image.png}}
* In @L_Amino_acids the @amine_group is on the left.
* In @D_Amino_acids it is on the right. They are not converted into protein, but can be used in the @Peptidoglycan @bacteria cell wall and as a @neurotransmitter

===== Evidence =====
The first signs of life on Earth (the @apex_chert ) are about as old as the @bombardment_phase ‚Üí the timing is right for life to have been brought to earth then.
@Impact_frustration is the theory that life on earth would have started earlier if it had not been interrupted by @asteroids impacts.

The @Alan_Hills_Meteorite from Mars in 1996 had things in it which looked like microfossils, but were actually just contaminants
