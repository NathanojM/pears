== Stromatolites ==
The next oldest evidence of life are the @stromatolites
Aged at 3.40 Ga, there's not much time between this and the Apex Chert 


* "Laminated Cauliflower Structures"
* Biosedimentary structures **≠≠≠** fossils
* @stromatolites are very long ranging fossils → useless as @Index_Fossils 
* Not controlled by time, but by paleoenvironmental conditions: amount of sunlight, nutrient avaliability
* Cyanobacteria are often found underneath stromatolites
* There was @debate about whether @Crytozoon were stromatolites or animal fossils
* They can form from {{./equation003.png?type=equation}}
 precipitated from @Prokaryotes , but they can be made abiotically.
* Come from shallow marine environments that the cyanobacteria need → @microbial_mat on the sea floor → changes pH of water → {{./equation.png?type=equation}}
 ppts out of solution → covers mat → mat oozes out frun underneath and covers limestone.

**Stromatolite structure:**
1. Growth Surface made of @Cyanobacteria gets the most sunlight
2. @undermat of photosynthetic bacteria still gets some light.
3. Oxgen depleted zone of anaerobic bactera, @Archea and @extremophiles

The layers are microecosystems which energy down the layers.

1. The water is a saturated solution of  {{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
2. When it's made alkaline by the microbial activity, the  {{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
 precipitaes out
3. The microbes use the new layer of  {{./equation004.png?type=equation}}
 as a substrate and settle on the new surface

Stromatolites generate their own reducing conditions.
The reduction of @uranium 6, which is found naturally in the seawater, causes it to precipitate out and become embedded in the stromatolite.

**Shapes**
Stromatolites come in lots of different shapes, or a combination of many.

Flat stromatolites indicate a stable water column and depth.
When the sea level rises, the photo zone tries to catch up and makes more layers
