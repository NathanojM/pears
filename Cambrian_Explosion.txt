====== Cambrian Explosion ======
Created Friday 17 February 2023
@GEOLOGY @paleontology  @YEAR4

@cambrian @cambrian_explosion 

The onset of the @phanerozoic saw the sudden appearance of more complex life, although this actually bagan in the @Precambrian 

The @cambrian_explosion is also known as the @biological_big_bang 

It is actually a series of multiple events:
1. The 'Cambrian' Explosion was a small @bioradiation event which started in the late @Precambrian and lasted 40 million years. @Biomineralisation emerged and the first animals with hard Phosphatic skeletons appeared
2. The @Great_Ordovician_Biodiversification_event or @GOBE which happened in the @Ordovician and saw the mass diversification of families 
3. ?

They are not the same event. @GOBE saw a much faster rate of evolution and much greater number of species than the Cambrian event.

===== Rate of evolution =====
{{./pasted_image.png?width=600}}
* @evolution reached a plateau after the Ordovician ‚Üí the rate of @extinction was in equilibrium with the rate of evolution in a @Punctuated_equilibrium 
* It stayed that way until the @permian_extinction
* However, bioradiation has been steadily rising since the @Triassic without reaching an @evolutionary_plateau ‚Üí @eco_space is being used more effectively ‚Üí more diversification
* After the @permian_extinction extinction stopped opening new @niches ‚Üí evolution accelerates 

{{./pasted_image001.png?width=600}}
The Precambrian is on the left, the Ordovician on the right

===== The Burgess Shale =====
* The @Burgess_shale has some quite bizarre fossils, some of which are failed evolutionary experiments, and some are ancient versions of modern fauna.
* Unlike other sites, it has organic preservation of soft body parts (arms and legs etc.) because the @Turbidity_currents 'sealed' the environment and made it a @reducing_environment 

===== Causes of diversification =====

==== Ecological causes ====
The emergence of predators caused prey to adapt for protection: they developed shells, spines and means of locomotion.
Those that couldn't adapt went extinct or migrated elsewhere.
{{./diagram.png?type=diagram}}

Global cooling ‚Üí migration towards the equator.
Those adapted to the cold will diversify and those adapted to the warm will decline.
{{./diagram001.png?type=diagram}}

@Pollinators and @flowers @co_evolve 
If the flowers go extinct, then they will drag the bees down with them
If the flowers evolve, so do the bees.

==== Geological causes ====
* When the atmosphere was oxygenated in the @great_oxidation_event , the @oxygen went into the ocean where it reacted with @iron to form @BIFs 
* This continued until all the iron in the ocean was used up, but the @phytoplankton were still producing oxygen. 
* The extra oxygen could only go into the atmosphere.
* The geological evidence for this is that the iron in terrestrial sediments acted as an oxygen sink ‚Üí continental @Red_Beds . The red colour indicates a chemically reducing environment, but not necessarily rich in iron. Less than 1ppm of Iron is enough to turn a sediment intensely red.
* @pyrite @uranium @conglomerates also disappear at this point, because oxygen destroys pyrite and @oxidised uranium.
* This is when the oxygen level in the atmosphere got high enough to support more active @metabolism (see [[Mass Extinction#anaerobic-mass-extinction|Anaerobic mass extinction]]). The oxygen enabled the use of @aerobic @metabolic_pathways 

Oxygen sinks included: Iron, @Carbon Uranium and @methane and each one of these is its own isolated @great_oxidation_event .

=== Global cooling ===
* There was a massive global cooling event 2.3 Ga ago.
* All the seawater was saturated with @oxygen ‚Üí the @atmosphere began to fill up and become @oxidised .
* The atmosphere was previously made of @methane but it reacted with the new oxygen.
* {{./equation001.png?type=equation}}
* Methane was replaced with a **less powerful** @greenhousegas ‚Üí global cooling



==== Genetic causes ====
Much of the diversity in body form among animals is associated with variations expression of @hox_genes 
Evolution of Hox genes ‚Üí variation in morphology as @embryos ‚Üí diversification of animals.

==== Abiogenic causes ====
{{./pasted_image007.png?width=500}}
* Multiple cycles of @Transgression and @Regression flooded the @continental_shelf and opened new @niches and forced evolution. 
* See the @Hawke_Bay_Extinction_Event  üìñÔ∏èhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.09.012
* The fall in sea level wiped out many niches, so the species had to adapt or perish.

* The increased crustal @erosion also changed the chemistry of the seawater
* Sea level and sediment accumulation rate affected the rate of fossilisation
* @nutrient availability
* Cycles of @supercontinents affected the amount of continental shelf available and the amount of @eco_space 


===== Palaeo Ecological Frame =====

@brackish
Most organisms in the @cambrian were adapted to the normal saline conditions and lived in shallow marine environments, but there were exceptions.
{{./pasted_image002.png?width=500}} {{./pasted_image004.png?width=500}}
@stromatolites are very adaptable. They need carbonate ions to build themselves, so are happiest in hypersaline environments away from grazing @Gastropods and other predators. They exist in fresh water, but they are **much **bigger in hypersaline environments.

Modern sea water composition
{{./pasted_image003.png}}

Palaeosalinity can be measured because minerals have traces of the seawater that they crystallised in. @calcite also has @Fluid_inclusions from when it was growing.

===== Eco Space =====
@Eco_space @sessile 

@Epifaunal = live on top of sediment
@Infaunal = live **in** the sediment
{{./pasted_image005.png?width=500}}
'High tier' means that they live high up.


* It was the @sessile communities which built @reefs in the Cambrian. They were resistant to @Waves and stood above other deposits.
* @Sponges existed in the Cambrian, but @coral didn't evolve until the @Ordovician 
* @Archaeocyathids are their own @phylum (they are not @Sponges  or a @coral ) and went extinct in the mid Cambrian.
* This means that reef eco space wasn't being used for millions of years. Nobody knows why.
* It is possible that the corals didn't have a {{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
 skeleton ‚Üí didn't precipitate anything.

@Biostromes are bedded blanket like extensive structures built by sessile organisms. The bedding is @Lenticular (meaning alternating layers of mud and sand)

@Bioherms are mounds made of the calcareous remains of oragnisms.

===== Evolution of foraging strategy =====

There was no @burrowing in the @Precambrian ‚Üí all trace fossils are in 2D
The Cambrian explosion saw the development of tighter meandering paths and more complex and efficient networks ‚Üí evolution of BEHAVIOUR.
{{./pasted_image006.png?width=500}}

===== Conquest of new habitats =====
The inhabitants of shallow marine environments diversified ‚Üí it became too crowded ‚Üí more competition ‚Üí some found homes in deeper waters which were previously uninhabited.

===== Importance of skeletons =====
@Skeletons have a number of purposes:
Support for muscles
Locomotion
Protection for soft internal organs
Storage of excess minerals
Storage of rare minerals used for @metabolism ( @phosphorus for @ATP )
