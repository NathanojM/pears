The @RNA world came before the @DNA world
Nobody has ever observed the transition from inanimate to living material.


There are 3 hypotheses for the evolution of viruses:

===== Hypothesis 1 =====
@Virus_first_hypothesis 
@Viruses are not technically alive, but they are hypothesised to fit here in the @tree_of_life as an intermediate step between inanimate and living things.

===== Hypothesis 2 =====
The @Degeneracy_hypothesis
Viruses need to hijack cells to survive â†’ if viruses fit here, they must have evolved after cellular life, because otherwise there would have been no cells to attack. The hypothesis says that viruses @devolved from larger @parasite cells 

===== Hypothesis 3 =====
@Escape_hypothesis 
Viruses evolved from genetic material which escaped from bigger organisms.
